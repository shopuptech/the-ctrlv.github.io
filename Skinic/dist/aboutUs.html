				<h1>AESTHETIC MEDICINE <br> IN ZURICH</h1>
				<h2>Dr. Dan Iselin</h2>
				<p>Dr. Iselin is an aesthetic physician in Zurich who specialises in non-surgical facial treatments. For the last ten years he has dedicated himself entirely to the gentle and natural application of botulinum and hyaluron. While these methods are only two of the many options on the market, they represent the foundation of every modern aesthetic medicine treatment.
				<br><br>
				Dr. Iselin’s approach to treatment places great emphasis on the effectiveness and safety of the chosen method, the natural look of the result and respect for the individual. Holistic integrity is the core and focus of his Zurich clinic.
				<br><br>
			    Dr. Iselin’s beauty clinic is located in the heart of Zurich and is easily accessible by car or public transport.</p>

				<h1>OUR SERVICES</h1>
				<p>Less is more. That is why I specialise in injection treatments with botulinum and hyaluron in my Zurich beauty clinic. We keep our range of treatments small, preferring to offer only therapies that are proven to be effective and safe. Merely believing in them is not enough for us: the procedures and products we offer must be backed up by convincing data and studies, and their clinical applications also have to be proven safe and effective. 
				<br><br>
				It’s good to be known as a ‘first mover’, but one should always critically examine new trends, as the number of treatments offered disproportionately exceeds the medical evidence. Therefore, we expand our treatment portfolio slowly and carefully, which is also in your best interest.
				<br><br>
				Instead of a standard waiting room, we have several private waiting areas. Thus, safe distance and discretion are maintained. You will feel looked after and comfortable with us.</p>

		<h1>TREATMENT PHILOSOPHY</h1>
		<span class="subHeader">We could go into this topic at great length, but there are four points that form the ultimate focus of our aesthetic medicine:</span>
		<ul class="benefits flex">
		   <li>
		      <span class="highlighted">01</span><span>Safety</span>
		      <p>The first two points must be well matched. First, the treatment must be completely safe; second, it must be effective. There is little regulation in the field of aesthetic medicine for the latter, and a large number of treatments are advertised for which the effectiveness is highly doubtful. At the very best, their safety is guaranteed. A doctor’s duty is to advise the client to the best of their knowledge and conscience and not to give in to pressure from the industry – including financial expectations. Accordingly, they should not exaggerate the expected results, and the advantages and disadvantages of each treatment should be critically examined and questioned.
		         Your safety is our top priority during treatment. However, the effectiveness and naturalness of the result are just as important.
		         In our beauty clinic in Zurich, we rely on the latest medical findings. We use only high quality, clinically proven and approved drugs and medical products.

				<h4>Inspiration and beauty ideals</h4>
				<div class="animated">
					<p>Aesthetic medicine has been in a state of ethical and moral tension for quite some time. In times of strained self-optimisation and a corresponding counter-movement, the polarities continue to build up. There are good reasons for and against an aesthetic treatment, and a person can spend years thinking about this decision.
					<br><br>
					In times like these, one realises that health is not a given and that a beautiful appearance is a privilege. When dealing with the way you look, accept it and make it your own decision. Don’t let any moral authority stop you from doing so and don’t submit to possible social ostracism. The people who are close to you and love you will continue to do so and accept you no matter what.</p>
					<h5>Ageing Gracefully</h5>
					<p>What does this phrase mean precisely, and who determines whether you lose grace when you decide on a treatment? We all grow up in specific value systems. Religious conditioning and other acquired beliefs and life philosophies help define the people we are. For some people, value-free action and thinking are, therefore, difficult to put into practice; but to make decisions free of constraints and fears is a valuable stage of personal development.</p>
