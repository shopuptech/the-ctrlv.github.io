				<h2>Treatment of frown lines for a relaxed and smooth facial expression</h2>
				<p>Involuntary and constant contraction of the eyebrows leads to an angry or stern appearance and, consequently, to the development of a permanently deep frown line. The affected person unintentionally sends out negative signals and is perceived negatively by other people. Many people want to have their frown lines treated or removed.
				<br><br>
				As well as innate habits, this negative trait is caused by both poor eyesight and a lot of concentrated reading. Over the years, these behavioural patterns cause permanent frown lines. While many methods of treatment exist, relaxation of the responsible frown muscles and, depending on the circumstances, filling the area are the only ways to remedy the condition. In order to achieve this, the frown lines receive an injection.
				<br><br>
				The ‘training away’ of frown lines with face yoga, meditation or other methods is only successful in isolated cases and requires extreme discipline over a long period. By using the active ingredient botulinum toxin-A (also known as Botox or botulinum) as an injection into the frown muscles, it is possible to achieve a temporary relaxation of them. This significantly reduces the frown line or eliminates it. In the case of deep frown lines, hyaluronic acid gel additionally fills the wrinkle or cavity to achieve an optimal result.</p>
				<h2>Treatment of frown lines for a relaxed and smooth facial expression</h2>
				<p>The active ingredient, approved for both medical and aesthetic treatment, is injected directly into the muscle, but with a delayed effect. This results in a pharmacologically induced, temporary interruption of the nerve signal to the tissue. It takes a few days before the active substance is absorbed and develops its effect at the specific target site. After 2-3 days, the first signs are visible. Within the initial 7-14 days, the full impact reveals itself. Maximum effect occurs after 5-6 weeks.</p>
				<h2>How do I know if it worked?</h2>
				<p>The immediate effect is reduced severity or total removal of the frown line. You will also experience difficulties in drawing your eyebrows together. If you are still able to do so, make sure that you do not have to squeeze your eyes tightly as well. This is an indication that, although the full effect is present, contracting the eyebrow requires the extra eye ring muscles.</p>
				<h2>Frown lines - botox or hyaluron?</h2>
				<p>As a starting point, the botulinum relaxes the hyperactive muscles. For preventative treatment, i.e. before the frown lines are deep and grooved, botulinum treatment is generally sufficient. If the frown line is already quite established, additional filling of the line is carried out with a hyaluronic acid gel during the first few wrinkle treatments. A combination treatment, or several treatment steps, is required. We usually recommend a primary treatment with botulinum before injecting the frown line.</p>
				<h2>How long does botulinum last in frown lines?</h2>
				<p>The active ingredient botulinum is a protein, which temporarily interrupts the signal transmission of the nerve endings via medicine. The change in the synapse that sends nerve signals is permanent throughout its active period. The effect of botulinum on these nerve endings only fades after a while. The duration of the botulinum’s effect depends on the injected quantity and the initial muscle mass, as well as the overall facial movements. The latter is different for each individual. 
				<br><br>
				The treatment interval for the usual dosage of botulinum used in aesthetic medicine is generally 3-6 months. In individual cases, the effect lasts for less than three or more than six months. After 8-12 weeks, however, a second injection of botulinum is necessary to reduce the underlying muscle mass and extend the interval between the individual wrinkle treatments.</p>
				<h2>The pain</h2>
				<p>Most people compare it to an insect bite, as fine needles insert the active ingredient to treat frown lines. Customers who have previously undergone acupuncture treatment find the botulinum treatment much less painful.</p>
				<h2>Risks</h2>
				<p>Local swelling and a slight redness appear in less than 10% of the treated cases during the first few hours. Blood accumulation (haematomas) and minor headaches occur in rare cases during the first few days. Regarding headaches, however, our observation shows that the opposite is often true, with a decrease in the frequency and intensity of pre-existing headaches, especially migraines. Some countries even approve botulinum for the treatment of chronic migraines.</p>
