					<h2>What is botulinum?</h2>
					<p>Botulinum (botulinum toxin-A) is a medical substance approved by the drug authorities and used to temporarily smooth wrinkles on the face. It is a biological protein obtained from a bacterium called ‘Clostridium Botulinum’. The active ingredient relaxes the facial muscles responsible for the development of wrinkles. Only trained specialists should carry out botulinum treatment. For the best effect, the treatment needs moderate doses and to be repeated at regular intervals (3–6 months).
					<br><br>
					Referring to the original compound which contained botulinum as an active ingredient, the term ‘Botox treatment’ is familiar as a generic term for all treatments with this active ingredient.
					<br><br>
					Dr. Iselin’s practice in Zurich specialises in botulinum treatments. He offers many years of experience in the field of aesthetic medicine.</p>
					<h2>How does botulinum work?</h2>
					<p>Firstly, a specialist injects the active substance accurately into the muscle with a thin needle. An injection of botulinum chemically stops the release of a signal. The transmission of stimuli from the nerve to the treated muscle is temporarily interrupted. The muscle relaxes, and the result is a reduction of wrinkles. This effect is temporary. When the effect wears off, the transmission recovers and the muscle function is completely restored. In the treatment of excessive sweating with botulinum, a twilight sleep occurs in the sweat glands instead of the muscles.</p>

					<h2>Where is botulinum used?</h2>
					<p>As an active ingredient, botulinum is an approved medication for the treatment of frown lines, crow’s feet and excessive underarm sweating. However, the active ingredient works for other expression wrinkles as well.</p>

						The effect generally lasts 3-6 months. However, this is on an individual basis and also depends on the treated area. The duration of the result also depends on the injected dose and the existing muscle activity and mass. Avoiding a mask-like face, also called ‘frozen face’, is contrary to the desire for a prolonged botulinum effect. We recommend moderate doses of botulinum for a natural result. Before treatment, professional advice and information is a must. Furthermore, a strategic treatment plan for anti-wrinkle treatment or prevention needs to be worked out together with the client.
