			<h1>Why Trade Bitcoin?</h1>
			<p>
				While there are many reasons to start trading Bitcoin, let’s start with an obvious fact. Fiat currencies and traditional investing are coming to an end. 
				<br><br>
				Things are going digital. We buy and sell things online, we study and entertain ourselves online, we purchase travel deals online.
				<br><br>
				Yet, online platforms like PayPal - once revolutionary - have also failed. With high transaction fees and slow processing times, we need better solutions. 
				<br><br>
				As Peter Thiel said, <i> “PayPal had these goals of creating a new currency. We failed at that, and we just created a new payment system. I think Bitcoin has succeeded on the level of a new currency, but the payment system is somewhat lacking. It’s very hard to use, and that’s the big challenge on the Bitcoin side.”</i>
				<br><br>
				Solutions that the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology can offer! Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a great alternative to traditional finances. No more hidden processing fees, no more waiting, no more leaked personal details!
				<br><br>	<br>
				<span class="semi-bold">Does this sound too abstract?</span>
				 <br><br>Well, the truth is that the number of Bitcoin ATMs is rising. Only in the UK, there are hundreds of BTC machines. Bitcoin can be used as a payment method in restaurants, cafes, and retail shops. You can get a Caffe Nero gift card with BTC. How much more real can things get?
				<br><br>	
				Bitcoin also brings us closer to bridging the wealth gap in today's world. Even unbanked people without a bank account can get a digital wallet and start buying Bitcoin and digital currencies. 
				<br><br>	
				And believe it or not, Bitcoin and other digital assets can also be used as an inflation hedge and protect economies worldwide. 
				<br><br>	
				And for those who don't think that's enough: Bitcoin owners have the unique chance to potentially make sufficient Bitcoin cash tucked safely in their crypto wallets.

					</span> How many bitcoins can I buy? </p>
					<p class="animated">You can purchase as many bitcoins (or other assets) as you want. You are in full control of any transaction you decide to execute. Note that Bitcoin’s value is high and may be unaffordable and risky. That said, you can buy just a small fraction, satoshi, and still own BTC. There are 100,000,000 SATS in one Bitcoin</p>

					</span> Can I make money if I purchase Bitcoin?</p>
					<p class="animated">Investing in cryptocurrency can be risky and profitable at the same time, as the sector is highly volatile. Many experts recommend buying Bitcoin when its price is low and selling Bitcoin when its value is high to potentially make money. Buy the dips, sell the rips, as the big fish say!</p>

					</span>How is Bitcoin stored?</p>
					<p class="animated">Any crypto is stored in a digital wallet. Imagine your Bitcoin like a computer file stored in a Bitcoin wallet. A Bitcoin wallet can be hot, online-based, or cold, hardware-based. Hot wallets are very convenient because you can access your Bitcoin wallet with ease. Similarly to an online bank account or PayPal, you can access your wallet through any device connected to the Internet. Almost any cryptocurrency exchange offers hot wallets. If you decide to open a hot wallet, privacy issues may arise. Your hot wallet may be compromised if the exchange service gets hacked. Cold wallets, on the other hand, provide safer options to store your private key, either on paper or a USB device. Research different digital wallet providers before you choose a cold wallet and decide on how to store your private key.</p>
